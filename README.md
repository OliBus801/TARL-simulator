# TARL-simulator

**Traffic Assignment via Reinforcement Learning** â€” an agent-based traffic simulation framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning (PPO) for Dynamic Traffic Assignment.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under active development** ðŸš§  
This project is currently in an early stage.  
Most core features are being implemented and are not yet ready for academic use.

## Overview

TARL-simulator aims to:
- Model transportation networks as graphs (dual graph representation).
- Simulate agents making adaptive route choices.
- Learn routing policies via reinforcement learning to approach User Equilibrium or optimal routing.

## Current Features

- Basic network and agent definitions.
- Preliminary routing logic using Dijkstra.
- Early integration of MPNN + PPO framework (*work in progress*).

## Planned Features

- Full RL training loop with policy evaluation.
- Advanced metrics (Nash gap, TSTT, Price of Anarchy).
- Support for synthetic and real-world network scenarios.
